# sprintly-tags

It's currently not possible to view all of the tags you've used in [Sprint.ly](https://sprint.ly), but they have an awesome API that makes it easy to find them.

Using your API credentials, this app will show you all the tags you've used across all of your products- linked, counted, and sorted.
